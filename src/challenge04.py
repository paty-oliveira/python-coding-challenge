    Randomnsess
    Define a function, random_number, that takes no parameters.
    The function must generate a random integer between 1 and 100, both inclusive, and return it.
    Calling the function multiple times should (usually) return different numbers.

    Example:
    >> random_number()
    >> 42 or 63 or 1 or another number until 100
