"""
    Adding and removing dots
    Write a function named add_dots that takes a string and adds "." in between each letter.
    Example:
    >> add_dots("test")
    >> t.e.s.t

    Then, write another function named remove_dots that removes all dots from a string.
    Example:
    >> remove_dots("t.e.s.t")
    >> test

    If both functions are correct, calling remove_dots(add_dots(string)) should return back
    the original string for any string.
