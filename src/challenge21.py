    Challenge
    Solution validation
    The aim of this challenge is to write code that can analyze code submissions.
    We'll simplify things a lot to not make this too hard.
    Write a function named validate that takes code represented as a string as its only parameter.

    Your function should check a few things:

    - the code must contain the def keyword
        - otherwise return "missing def"
    - the code must contain the : symbol
        - otherwise return "missing :"
    - the code must contain ( and ) for the parameter list
        - otherwise return "missing paren"
    - the code must not contain ()
        - otherwise return "missing param"
    - the code must contain four spaces for indentation
        - otherwise return "missing indent"
    - the code must contain validate
        - otherwise return "wrong name"
    - the code must contain a return statement
        - otherwise return "missing return"
    If all these conditions are satisfied, your code should return True.

def validate(param):
    pass
