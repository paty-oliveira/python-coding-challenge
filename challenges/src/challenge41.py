"""
The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

Here's the deal:

It must start with a hashtag (#).
All words must have their first letter capitalized.

Examples
" Hello there thanks for trying my Kata"  =>  "#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata"
"    Hello     World   "                  =>  "#HelloWorld"
""                                        =>  ""

"""


def generate_hashtag(phrase: str) -> str:
    return "#" + phrase.title().replace(" ", "") if len(phrase) > 0 else ""
